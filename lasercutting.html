<h1> Laser Cutting </h1>
<p> Starting this project was super fun! I was excited to make my own box. I explored the box generator website linked on the laser cutting page and scheduled my training for tuesday night with Whitney! I also met Giana who was working on the digital embroidery machine, and now I'm very much looking forward to training with her as well!
<p>
<p>Due to Yom Kippur being on Thursday this week, and having a doctors appointment on friday, I wouldn't be back on campus until Saturday. So, I scheduled my time to work with the laser cutter for Wednesday in between my classes. I was glad when I went in to use it that both Madison and (I'm so sorry if you ever see this, I forget your name,) another TA was there! They were very helpful as I figured out the nuts and bolts of making a box. First, we reviewed some safety protocols for the laser cutter, which are very important as it is a LASER. One that I hadn't known before that wednesday, was making sure the blinds were closed so the glare from the window doesn't affect the machine!</p>

<img src= "lasercut5.png" style="width:40%;" >
<img src= "lasercut3.png" style="width:40%;" >
<p> Now, I sent one of the flex sides of the box and the inner lid to cut! 
</p>
<img src="lasercut1.png" style="width: 40%" >
<img src="lasercut2.png" style="width:40%" >
<img src="lasercut6.png" style="width:40%" >
<img src="lasercut7.png" style="width:40%" >

<p>The fingers fit perfectly together! So, I loaded up the other parts of the box into glow forge, refocused the machine, and sent those to cut. This round of pieces included my rastered initials. I actually placed multiple initials to be rastered on the pieces because I wasn't quite sure looking at the diagram which piece would be the top of the lid for the box.</p>
<img src="lasercut8.png" style="width:40%" >
<img src="lasercut9.png" style="width:40%" >
<p> After the machine finished cutting and cooling down, I took my last few pieces out of it and started trying ot fit them together. With the suggestion of a hammer and some help from Madison, I was able to fit the bottom of the box into the flex side that I had cut first.</p>
<img src= "lasercut10.png" style="width:40%;" >
<p> Unfortunately, my second flex side did not print as well. Madison said this was likely due to the fact that when working with natural materials the thicknes may vary, as well as the focus of the laser cutter.</p>
<img src= "lasercut11.png" style="width:40%" >
<p>So, I reloaded the file into glowforge, refocsued it, and went to cut it again.</p>
  <img src= "lasercut13.png" style="width:40%" >
  <img src= "lasercut14.png" style="width:40%" >
<p>This time it came out right! The laser cut all the way through. I started fitting the box together, and due to the curved nature of the tip of the heart, I realized I'd need to use a bit of glue. Madison helped me find some wood glue and binder clips to hold the pieces in place while they dried. </p>

<img src= "finishedbox2.png" style="width:40%" >

<p>I love how it came out! It's such a nice little box, I'll definitely find a use for it in my dorm.</p>
