<h1> Vinyl Cutting! </h1>
<p> I was excited to start this project! I've never used a real vinyl cutter like there is in the maker space at wheaton before, and my vinyl knowledge was from circuts or doing it by hand! I made my appointment to get trained, and headed to the maker space <p>
    <img src= "vinyl 1.png" style="width:45%" >
    <p> This is the vinyl cutter</p>
    <img src= "vinyl 2.png" style="width:45%" >
    <p> my first test was with a simple snowflake design</p>
    <img src= "vinyl 3.png" style="width:45%" >
    <p>Here is Madison showing me how to weed the vinyl</p>
    <img src= "vinyl 4.png" style="width:45%" >
    <p> with letters you have to remember to flip the design!</p>
    <img src= "vinyl 5.png" style="width:45%" >

    <p> After the training with Madison, Vinyl Cutting was a lot easier to understand! I think Vinyl Cutting absolutely is a form of digital fabrication, especially when done with the large vinyl cutter. You have to be able to digitally choose and edit your designs, and format them correctly to be sent to the vinyl cutter. You have to be able to know how to turn your raster image - which is comprised of colred pixels, into a vector image - which is comprised of pathways. Although I'd heard these words before I didn't fully understand how they went into creating with digital images. Vector images are best suited for designs, and since I love digital art and have a small business that I've been considering adding more products too, learning how to vectorize an image in illustrator was really helpful! </p>

<p> Now it was time to start thinking about my design! I really wanted to use the pink glitter vinyl that I saw earlier in the lab, and make something cute and fun! Knowing that I needed to have a 14 character quote included in my overall design affected what I could do. After doodling a bit in my statistics class, I came up with a cute cat sketch, inspired by the starbucks logo! I really wanted to make a shirt I would actually wear, so this design felt like moving in the right direction. A cute, pink, glittery, coffee, cat? What could be better!?
</p>

<img src= "vinyl 7.png" style="width:45%" >

<p>Now I headed back to the lab! There were a few hiccups in my process. Despite already trying to have my image edited in Ai with it's text, it was in the wrong format! Whitney helped me change my pdf into an svg for Sir Chops a Lot, and it was finally able to send to the cutter.</p>
<img src= "vinyl 8.png" style="width:45%" >
<p>My print worked! but when I went to weed it I realized - I'd forgotten to flip the image so the text would come out correctly! My text was backwards. I went back to the computer, flipped the image, and sent it to the cutter again.</p>
<img src= "vinyl 9.png" style="width:45%" >
<p> Now my design was working! And boy, was it looking cute! I did two rounds on the heat press before I even tried to peel off the plastic, because in my training I had trouble getting the design to stick fully! With the two 10 second rounds on the heat press, my design came out perfect. </p>
    <img src= "vinyl 10.png" style="width:45%" >
<p>I have a very short torso, and I mostly wear crop tops, so I decided to turn this tshirt into a crop top, so I could get some more use out of it!</p>
<img src= "1cat shirt.png" style="width: 40%" >
<p>I love how the design came out! And it was a very interesting and fun process to learn!</p>
